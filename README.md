# Minimization DFA


This project is a tool for minimizing DFAs (Deterministic Finite Automata). It allows users to visually observe and analyze input DFAs and also convert them into a minimized form.


## Features
- **DFA Visualization:** Ability to visually draw DFAs.
- **DFA Minimization:** Automated tools for minimizing DFAs.
- **Draggable States:** Users can move states around the canvas.
- **Built with Java and JavaFX:** This project is implemented using Java and JavaFX.

## Installation and Usage
1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/amir-azari/DFA-Editor-and-Minimizer.git

## How to add input

- **Defining Symbols:** Symbols should be separated by spaces. For example: `a b c`.
- **Defining States:** States should be separated by spaces. For example: `q1 q2 q3`.

## How to Draw DFA

- **Adding States:** `Right-click` on the canvas to add a state.
- **Dragging States:** States can be dragged by `left-clicking` and holding.
- **Selecting Start and Final States:** You can select states for transitions by holding `CTRL` + `left-clicking` on them.
- **Defining Final and Start States:** Double `left-click` on a state to mark it as a final state or a start state, or to remove these designations.
- **Changing Position of Self-loop States:** `left-click` on self-loop states to change their position.
- **Managing Transitions:** You can manage transitions using `Undo` and `Redo` functionality.
- **Updating Transitions:** Transitions can be updated as needed.
